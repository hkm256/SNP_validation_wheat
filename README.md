# Wheat UNEAK GBS- SNPs validated
## Two python scripts to identify the homeologous mismatches that could wrongly be identified as SNPs using Tassel-UNEAK pipeline for Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) in polyploid species such as wheat.
### Prerequisite would the wheat survey sequences (from IWGSC) installed as a blast database.
### Can be extended to other polypoids where complete reference sequences are not available
